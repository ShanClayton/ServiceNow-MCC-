# ServiceNow Consulation Project

#Description
Client owns a holiday decor business and would like to implement a measure to collect consultation requests reports, provide self-serv capablities to customers
for requesting consults, purchasing premade holiday decor, and requesting custom made decor, and establish a knowledge base to provide customers with important information
or updates. I developed and configured a scoped application with a knowledge base, service catalog, incident task, and request modules providing ease of access
to all users provided access control to the application.
